# Ansible lab
This vagrant file creates a complex scenario. The scenario includes a load balance machine two servers to application and one server to the database. The idea is to create a lab that you can practice simples ansibles commands and complex deploy orchestration too.

### Create and start a lab
```sh
$ vagrant up
```

### Remove all machines
```sh
$ vagrant destroy
```
